# Learning RaspbianOS

## Day 4

### 2022 January 10th

( [View yesterdays entry](/Learn-Pi/New-Pi/2022/January/09/) | [View tomorrows entry](/Learn-Pi/New-Pi/2022/January/11/) )

It has been decided that goals will be split across 7 day intervals, as I can't get to everything in one day.

Some of my goals for this week (2022 Sunday January 9th to 2022 Saturday, January 13th) include:

- [ ] Disable sleep mode

* Solution 1:

- - 1. Install `xscreensaver`

- - 2. Go to appearance and turn screensavers to `off`

- - 3. Reboot

* Solution 2:

- - 1. Research a solution if S1 fails

- [ ] Learn how to purge Chromium completely (delete it, and every single trace of it from the system, it should NOT have been a default browser)

- [x] Learn how to install programs

- - [ ] Install Firefox

- - [ ] Install RetroPie

- - - [ ] Install EmulationStation

- [ ] Install (Extras)

- - [ ] Install Neofetch

- - [ ] Install CowSay

- [ ] Learn how to properly exit programs from full screen mode (such as Minecraft Pi edition)

- [ ] Other/unlisted/no other entries


What I learnt today (by experimentation):

- [ ] Nothing yet.

<!-- I didn't spend much time on these goals today, I will try to get to them another time. !-->

Old, but needs revisit

- [x] 4K display: make it so I don't have to wear glasses AND strain my eyes to see what I am doing (I am really glad it is not an 8K or higher device because of this reason) In a nutshell: fix the display resolution (I have 2 1080p displays, so this wasn't an issue. I was using another device originally to test it. It will need to be looked at in the future though.)

I haven't gotten to use my Pi4 for a while. My current goal is to get the TV to stay on long enough first (and not have it shut down/go into sleep mode after every 15 minutes) it is hindering me from starting usage. - 2022 January 10th
