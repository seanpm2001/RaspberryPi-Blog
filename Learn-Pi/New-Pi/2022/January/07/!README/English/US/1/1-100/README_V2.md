# Learning RaspbianOS

## Day 1

### 2022 January 7th

( **No older entries** | [View tomorrows entry (day 2)](/Learn-Pi/New-Pi/2022/January/08/) )

I have assembled my CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 today. Although mostly pre-assembled, it was the first time I have built a computer. I have a lot to learn about it. With some tinkering, I have learnt a few things today.

### Previous knowledge

- [x] Raspberry Pi systems can be run off an SD card (2021 December 24th)

- [x] The rainbow screen is either a loading screen or a screen telling you that your HDMI connection is improper (2021 December 24th)

- [x] RISC-V-OS along with an array of other FOSS operating systems are also pre-loaded onto the partition (2021 December 24th)

- [x] My Raspberry Pi is a 32 bit system :( (2021 December 24th)

- [x] Installing from an SD card (2021 December 24th)

- [x] The look and feel of RaspbianOS (2021 December 24th)

- [x] RaspbianOS is Debian based (Pre-2020)

- [x] The extremely outdated Minecraft Pi Edition (Pre-2019)

- [x] RaspbianOS is Linux-based (pre-2018)

### New knowledge (2022 January 7th)

- [x] LibreOffice is pre-installed

- [x] Scratch 1.4 and 2.0 are pre-installed

- [x] Sonic Pi is pre-installed

- [x] The installer DOES have a progress bar, but it is cut off depending on your display resolution

- [x] The CanaKit partitions the device | 1 GB | 127 GB | onto a highly durable, stress tested 128 gigabyte SD card 

- [x] NOOBs stands for **N**ew **O**ut **O**f **B**ox software, and refers to the Out of Box experience you get with it.

- [x] It is not easy to change the display resolution, but it can be made slightly better by optimizing it for smaller screenshots

- [x] Minecraft Pi edition has many problems with RaspbianOS (originally used as a test application "just for the heck of it" it turned out to be a buggy mess)

- - [x] Minecraft Pi edition is very slow and has graphical problems

- - [x] The current version `v0.1.1 alpha` hasn't been updated **since February 11th 2013** and limits you to 8 blocks and 1 item, does not allow world customization (eg: seeds, world name, etc.) but Minecraft is Minecraft :)

- - [x] The game does not have a proper exit function, and you will need to `TTY7` out of the game and exit your X ORG session, then type $`reboot` to restart your system. There doesn't appear to be any other way at the moment. (some of the information in this subfact may be off, as I am going off the research of someone else, and what I am seeing. I did not get full context here, and am only showing the context I received)

- [x] `CTRL` + `ALT` + `F1` throws you into the command line

- [x] How to log out, shut down, and restart

- [x] Chromium is a pre-installed browser, and Firefox isn't an option for some stupid reason

- [x] No other knowledge from this day
