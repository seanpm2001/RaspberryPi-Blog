# Learning RaspbianOS

## Day 2

### 2022 January 8th

I have recently assembled my CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 (on 2022 January 7th) although mostly pre-assembled, it was the first time I have built a computer. I have a lot to learn about it. It feels like I am getting into `REAL` Linux, maybe it is just the difficulty of the display that is off setting me.

Some of my goals for today include:

- [ ] 4K display: make it so I don't have to wear glasses AND strain my eyes to see what I am doing (I am really glad it is not an 8K or higher device because of this reason) In a nutshell: fix the display resolution

- [ ] Learn how to purge Chromium completely (delete it, and every single trace of it from the system, it should NOT have been a default browser)

- [ ] Learn how to install programs

- - [ ] Install VLC Media Player

- - [ ] Install Firefox

- [ ] Learn how to properly exit programs from full screen mode (such as Minecraft Pi edition)

- [ ] Other/unlisted/no other entries
