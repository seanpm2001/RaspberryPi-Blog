# Learning RaspbianOS

## Day 2

### 2022 January 8th

I have recently assembled my CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 (on 2022 January 7th) although mostly pre-assembled, it was the first time I have built a computer. I have a lot to learn about it. It feels like I am getting into `REAL` Linux, maybe it is just the difficulty of the display that is off setting me.

Some of my goals for today include:

- [x] 4K display: make it so I don't have to wear glasses AND strain my eyes to see what I am doing (I am really glad it is not an 8K or higher device because of this reason) In a nutshell: fix the display resolution (I have 2 1080p displays, so this wasn't an issue. I was using another device originally to test it. It will need to be looked at in the future though.)

- [ ] Learn how to purge Chromium completely (delete it, and every single trace of it from the system, it should NOT have been a default browser)

- [ ] Learn how to install programs

- - [x] Install VLC Media Player (already installed by default, just didn't notice it immediately)

- - [ ] Install Firefox

- [ ] Learn how to properly exit programs from full screen mode (such as Minecraft Pi edition)

- [ ] Other/unlisted/no other entries

What I learnt today (by experimentation):

- [x] Pinning programs to the desktop

- [x] Changing the wallpaper (I actually learnt this on January 7th)

- [x] The cool installed programs and programming environments (Mathematica, Python, Scratch 1.4, 2.0, AND 3.0, Java, Sonic Pi, and more)

- - [x] Additional but unrelated: Python knowledge: I can't believe I didn't know this earlier, but print statements cannot have a space on char 6 (eg: `print ("Hello World")` is wrong, and `print("Hello World")` is right. I was always told it was optional, but strict Python interpreters enforce this)

- [x] That the rainbow screen is normal, and the system takes a long time to start up (my configuration runs entirely off an SD card, it does not contain an HDD or SSD)

- [x] That VLC Media Player is pre-installed

I didn't spend much time on these goals today, I will try to get to them another time.
